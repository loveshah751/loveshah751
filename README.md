Here is what my weekend Schedule looks like :sweat_smile:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning embedding models in GenAI and the internals of transformers.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any open-source project in the JAVA language.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything about event-driven Architecture, reactive programming, and Spring boot.
